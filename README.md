## Mission

With the advent of COVID-19, a problem that we were already familiar with - queues - has been reinforced.
The world of queues has stood still, despite the fact that many other sectors have undergone changes thanks to digital innovation, as far as queues are concerned we are still at the display issuing of paper tickets.
This obviously leads to a big waste of resources both in terms of electronic materials (such as displays) and in terms of space and paper.
 
Our Mission is therefore to innovate this sector by implementing a technology already strongly applied to "proximity marketing": the **BEACON**.
It is a hardware with reduced dimensions (we can hold it comfortably in the palm of one hand) that through Bluetooth technology (BLE) allows us to interact with the devices within its range of action.
 
By combining a **BEACON** with a series of algorithms we are able to identify how many people (equipped with devices - smartphones) are present at a certain point, maintaining the safety of their privacy, and then we can trace the exact number of people in the queue at the supermarket near home.
This type of approach is vertical, it means that we will not limit ourselves to an application aimed at supermarkets, but we would like it to be applied to any type of context: post offices, municipal offices, restaurants, pharmacies, etc.


## Wiki

How do we intend to accomplish this feat?
We will connect the **beacon** with an algorithm and a web application.
The Beacon will only validate the users in the queue, then check whether or not they are present.
The **web application** will show a map thanks to **Google API** through which those who connect to the web address [quick-q](https://quick-q.com) can see in real time how many people are queuing in a specific place of interest, you can also request to be updated on the status of a specific queue.
The **algorithms** will instead process the data and be able to evaluate statistics.
